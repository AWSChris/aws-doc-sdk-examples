# Amazon Q Developer Integration with AWS Bedrock

This document outlines how to integrate Amazon Q Developer with AWS Bedrock for enhanced generative AI capabilities.

## Overview

Amazon Q Developer is an AI-powered assistant that can help developers build, deploy, and operate applications on AWS. When integrated with AWS Bedrock, Amazon Q Developer can leverage foundation models to provide more powerful code generation, natural language understanding, and problem-solving capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to Amazon Q Developer and AWS Bedrock
- Appropriate IAM permissions for both services
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

## Integration Steps

### 1. Enable AWS Bedrock Access

First, ensure your account has access to AWS Bedrock and the foundation models you want to use:

```bash
aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-west-2
```

### 2. Configure Amazon Q Developer Settings

Configure Amazon Q Developer to use AWS Bedrock models:

```bash
aws q-developer update-settings \
    --bedrock-foundation-model-id anthropic.claude-v2 \
    --region us-west-2
```

### 3. Create Custom Prompts

You can create custom prompts in AWS Bedrock that Amazon Q Developer can use:

```python
import boto3

bedrock_agent = boto3.client('bedrock-agent')

response = bedrock_agent.create_prompt(
    name="CodeOptimizationPrompt",
    description="Prompt for optimizing Python code",
    template="Optimize the following Python code for performance: {{code}}",
    modelId="anthropic.claude-v2"
)

prompt_id = response['id']
print(f"Created prompt with ID: {prompt_id}")
```

### 4. Use Amazon Q Developer with Bedrock

Once integrated, you can use Amazon Q Developer with AWS Bedrock capabilities:

- Code generation with foundation model support
- Natural language queries about AWS services
- Troubleshooting with enhanced context understanding
- Code optimization and refactoring

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate foundation model based on your use case
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Design effective prompts for your specific tasks
3. **Cost Management**: Monitor usage to control costs
4. **Security**: Ensure proper IAM permissions and data handling

## Example Use Cases

- Generate complex code snippets with detailed requirements
- Translate code between programming languages
- Debug and fix issues in existing code
- Create and optimize infrastructure as code templates
